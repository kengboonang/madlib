CLimbing:

date and time
name
country
item
relative
transport
drink
gender


On a 'date and time', 'name' decided to go on a climbing trip in 'country'. "Don't forget to bring your 'item'" yelled 'name' 's 'relative'. 'name' kept a mental note but ended up forgetting either way. Upon travelling via 'transport' to 'country' 's climbing area, 'name' took out a bottle of 'drink' that was prepared beforehand to quench their thirst. All's good and 'name' reached the famed climbing area. Just as 'gender' was about to get on the first route, 'name' realised that 'gender' forgot to bring their 'item' and broke down in tears. The end.


Cooking:

feeling
food
verb and activity
vehicle
duration
location
cooking equipment
ingredient

Whenever I get 'feeling', I will be inclined to make a bowl of 'food'. Right after finising up on 'verb and activity', I got into the mood and decided to cook. I got on a 'vehicle' and took about 'duration' to reach my 'location' and took out my favourite 'cooking equipment'. After heating up the 'cooking equipment', I realised that the dish simply had to have 'ingredient'. But alas, I was too lazy to get the missing ingredient and just went back to sleep. The end.

Venting:

action ending with -ing
person
sport
favourite dish
how would you cheat in an exam
describe a situation where you'd get slapped with a fish
your income

Whenever I feel pissed, I like to vent by 'action ending with -ing'. One time while venting, I met 'person' and we decided to have a friendly competition of 'sport'. The loser was to treat both participants to a meal of 'favourite dish'. Taking into account 'person' 's weaknesses, I deicided to cheat by 'how would you cheat in an exam'. This turned out pretty badly when 'describe a situation where you'd get slapped with a fish'. It was not meant to be and I had to pay 'your income' while losing the competition and still feeling pissed. The End.
